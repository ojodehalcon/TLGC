Thanks for purchasing the Old School Modern graphics pack! :)

This resource pack contains a collection of graphics that allow you to create games with a retro-modern feel, similar to classic games like Earthbound or Pokemon. 
It is intended for use in RPG Maker VX ACE. By purchasing this pack, you have full rights to use these graphics in any RPG Maker program (XP, VX, VX Ace and any future RPG Maker products), as well as IG Maker.

+    How to add the Resource Pack to your game
+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After the Resource Pack, "OLD SCHOOL MODERN Tile Pack One" is completely downloaded to your computer, unzip it and place the folder in your desired location. 

1. Open RPG Maker VX Ace:
Open RPG Maker VX Ace and the project you wish to add the Resource Pack to. Select Resource Manager -----> Graphics/System -----> Import -----> Choose the resource files and then import them.

2. Creating the tileset:
In the RPG Maker VX Ace database, select the Tilesets tab. There you can add the imported graphics into a tileset.

3. Passability:
After the tileset is created, you will have to manually set the passability of the tiles yourself. You can do this by clicking the Passage Settings, and giving each tile the appropriate settings.

+   Artist's Note
+
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Thanks for purchasing my pack of graphics. :)

The black road autotile is best used with the sidewalk autotile around it—though it is intended to work with the grass tile around it as well. 
There are lane markings in Tile B that you can use on top of the road. 

You may need to make use of the SHIFT key while creating maps to prevent unsightly autotile borders. 
You can read more about this technique in the "Editing Map Design" section of the RPG Maker VX Ace help file.

Some objects (such as the computer tiles) are intended to be placed on top of other objects (such as the desk and counter tiles). 
This is best achieved by creating an event using the graphic of the top tile so that the tiles can properly overlap each other.

I hope you enjoy using these graphics as much as I enjoyed making them. :)
